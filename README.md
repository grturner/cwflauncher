Fourth Party Launcher
===========
Welcome to the Fourth Party Launcher for Cube World. 

Instructions:
Download launcher.exe and run it. 
The program does not need to be placed into your Cube World install directory. 
Note: As of right now, this launcher will only work with the default install path. If you have moved your Cube World folder elsewhere, this will not work for you.
